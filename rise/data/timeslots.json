He returned to Beijing and joined AsiaInfo in 2000.\n \nIn 2006, recognizing the contribution that the 60 million small and micro enterprises make to the Chinese economy, and inspired by the fledgling microfinance sectors in other developing economies, Ning established CreditEase. The philosophy behind the business was and remains today that everyone deserves access to credit, and that credit can generate value for all sectors of the community. This guiding philosophy has underpinned the growth of the business from a single product business in 2006, to today's diversified financial services business, and the core of the business remains focused on those sectors of the community who find it difficult to access the formal (bank) credit sectors.\n \nHeartened by the response of clients to the initial product offering, and their high creditworthiness, Ning has expanded the business to cover new customer segments and geographies, building out the management team and internal capabilities at the same time. CreditEase now provides products and services to farmers and agricultural borrowers, microfinance clients, consumers, micro-businesses and wealth management clients covering 232 cities（including Hong Kong）and 96 rural areas across China.\n\nMr. Tang is a member of Tsinghua University China Entrepreneur Training Program`s advisory committee, an advisor to the Peking University Social Entrepreneurship Training Program, and was recognized as an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012."},{"id":614903,"name":"Isabella Zhong","company":"Barron's","career":"Reporter","avatar_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bouncer-prod/madmin_attendees/65122/medium/65122?1464103611","country":"Hong Kong","bio":"Isabella Zhong is a Hong Kong-based financial journalist with Barron's.

He returned to Beijing and joined AsiaInfo in 2000.\n \nIn 2006, recognizing the contribution that the 60 million small and micro enterprises make to the Chinese economy, and inspired by the fledgling microfinance sectors in other developing economies, Ning established CreditEase. The philosophy behind the business was and remains today that everyone deserves access to credit, and that credit can generate value for all sectors of the community. This guiding philosophy has underpinned the growth of the business from a single product business in 2006, to today's diversified financial services business, and the core of the business remains focused on those sectors of the community who find it difficult to access the formal (bank) credit sectors.\n \nHeartened by the response of clients to the initial product offering, and their high creditworthiness, Ning has expanded the business to cover new customer segments and geographies, building out the management team and internal capabilities at the same time. CreditEase now provides products and services to farmers and agricultural borrowers, microfinance clients, consumers, micro-businesses and wealth management clients covering 232 cities（including Hong Kong）and 96 rural areas across China.\n\nMr. Tang is a member of Tsinghua University China Entrepreneur Training Program`s advisory committee, an advisor to the Peking University Social Entrepreneurship Training Program, and was recognized as an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012."},{"id":603773,"name":"Cliff Zhang","company":"PPDai","career":"Founder \u0026 CEO","avatar_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bouncer-prod/madmin_attendees/64818/medium/64818?1462806079","country":"China","bio":"Cliff Zhang is the CEO of ppdai.com, which aims to make financial services reachable for everyone."},{"id":599617,"name":"Melissa Guzy","company":"Arbor Ventures","career":"Founding Partner","avatar_url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/summitid/people/61528/medium/melissa.jpg?1436880474","country":"Hong Kong","bio":"With 25+ years of experience, Melissa is a Co-Founder and the Managing Partner at Arbor Ventures and was a Managing Director at VantagePoint Capital Partners."}],"topics":["FinTech"],"similar_timeslots":[6383,6729,6627,6624,6628],"private":false,"timeslot_format":"Panel","note":null},{"id":6666,"title":"Kabam: The Franchise Player","start_time":"2016-06-01 16:05:00","end_time":"2016-06-01 16:30:00","description":"As mobile gaming looks to define and redefine its core model we will explore the move to a franchise based model","conference_id":14,"conference_slug":"rise16","location":{"id":223,"name":"Centre Stage","stage_icon_font_name":"h","private":false,"content_producer":"Brian","description":null},"slot_type":null,"speakers":[{"id":602966,"name":"Holly Liu ","company":"Kabam","career":"Co-Founder","avatar_url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/bouncer-prod/madmin_attendees/58709/medium/58709?1462976230","country":"China","bio":"Holly Liu is co-founder and Chief Development Officer of Kabam, leading the development of Kabam internationally, focusing primarily on China."},{"id":600240,"name":"David Rowan","company":"Wired ","career":"Editor ","avatar_url":"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/summitid/people/55526/medium/Rowan-David_680p_RGB.jpg?1437735012","country":"United Kingdom","bio":"Editor-in-chief of WIRED's UK edition.
